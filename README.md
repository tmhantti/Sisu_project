# Sisu_project
<h3>Simplified student information system</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This was our (me + two other students) project work for Java programming course ('Programming 3', Tampere University, fall 2022).
I emphasize that this was a group effort.  </p>


My contribution to the project was the following:
- implementation of routines for retrieving data from API
- implementation of classes related to backend
- implementation of a graphical component (TreeView element)

Project was created with Apache NetBeans IDE 17.  See sisu_documentation.pdf for more details.
