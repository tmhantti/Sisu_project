# Sisu_project
Simplified student information system

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This was our (me + two other students) project work for Java programming course ('Programming 3', Tampere University, fall 2022).
I emphasize that this was a group effort.  </p>


My contribution to the project was the following:
- implementation of routines for retrieving data from API
- implementation of classes related to backend
- implementation of one graphical component (TreeView)
